[[ v0.3.71 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o14-11-25 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Successfully installed the Firefox Addon SDK and created a test
    extension. Also achieved the necessary URL matching and jQuery
    implementation. Then tried porting one or two modules with similar 
    success.
    
    Finally managed to pay the fee for Chrome Developers and drafted FLEX
    in the official Chrome Web Store.



· (( 2o14-11-19 ))

Update module:
    Edited a regular expression in the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module 
    and modified the title recognition routine in general for better 
    support of Wikipedia tracklists.



· (( 2o14-11-16 ))

New module:
    Finalized the "Categorize EAL" module, ready for QA.



· (( 2o14-11-15 ))

Organizing:
    Restructured the change.log files.



· (( 2o14-11-14 ))

New module:
    Planned new "Search Lists" module, including ticketing.


New module:
    Continue working on "Categorize EAL" module. Injection. Clickability.
    Basic functionality. Works!



· (( 2o14-11-13 ))

New module:
    Spontaneous idea: I could logically categorize pre-tagged items in the 
    Edit-a-List environment. Started realizing first ideas right away.



· (( 2o14-11-o8 ))

Module update:
    Removed an unnecessary button in the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module.



· (( 2o14-1o-29 ))

Module update:
    Applied some trivial bugfixes and optimization to the "Quicken Album
    Tracklist" module.



· (( 2o14-1o-26 ))

Structure & module update:
    Set up the v0.3.71 environment and implemented a few trivial things into
    the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module.


Organization & cross-browser support:
    Looked into the current state of affairs in terms of Firefox, and 
    re-organized a bunch of tickets and milestones. Gotta keep thinking in
    baby steps.
