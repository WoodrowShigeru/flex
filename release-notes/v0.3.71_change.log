[[ v0.3.71 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o15-o1-o1 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Fixed the "Custom Quicklinks" module in Firefox.



· (( 2o14-12-29 ))

Cross-browser support & bugfix:
    Stress-tested the quick'n'dirtily implemented modules on Firefox.
    The first batch. And optimized the preference descriptions.



· (( 2o14-12-27 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Figured out how to handle preferences in Firefox in order for my 
    modules to trigger only when asked by the user.  Ported over the 
    bulk of my modules, quick'n'dirtily.



· (( 2o14-12-22 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Aaaaand I fixed it again. This time, I *know* why package.json kept 
    becoming  broken, so this shouldn't halt me again like this.



· (( 2o14-12-2o ))

Cross-browser support:
    Continued editing my package.json file for Firefox which managed to 
    destroy it again. I don't understand.



· (( 2o14-12-18 ))

Cross-browser support:
    After having accidentally broken my package.json file for Firefox a few
    days ago, today I finally managed to "repair" it.



· (( 2o14-11-27 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Ported a few more modules over, from Chrome to Firefox. Figured out
    resource-injection with content scripts.


Release:
    Prepared the Chrome-only release on the official store.


Bugfix:
    Fixed trivial bugs in the "Quicken Album Tracklist" and "Hide Debug Box" 
    modules.



· (( 2o14-11-25 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Successfully installed the Firefox Addon SDK and created a test
    extension. Also achieved the necessary URL matching and jQuery
    implementation. Then tried porting one or two modules with similar 
    success.
    
    Finally managed to pay the fee for Chrome Developers and drafted FLEX
    in the official Chrome Web Store.



· (( 2o14-11-19 ))

Update module:
    Edited a regular expression in the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module 
    and modified the title recognition routine in general for better 
    support of Wikipedia tracklists.



· (( 2o14-11-16 ))

New module:
    Finalized the "Categorize EAL" module, ready for QA.



· (( 2o14-11-15 ))

Organizing:
    Restructured the change.log files.



· (( 2o14-11-14 ))

New module:
    Planned new "Search Lists" module, including ticketing.


New module:
    Continue working on "Categorize EAL" module. Injection. Clickability.
    Basic functionality. Works!



· (( 2o14-11-13 ))

New module:
    Spontaneous idea: I could logically categorize pre-tagged items in the 
    Edit-a-List environment. Started realizing first ideas right away.



· (( 2o14-11-o8 ))

Module update:
    Removed an unnecessary button in the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module.



· (( 2o14-1o-29 ))

Module update:
    Applied some trivial bugfixes and optimization to the "Quicken Album
    Tracklist" module.



· (( 2o14-1o-26 ))

Structure & module update:
    Set up the v0.3.71 environment and implemented a few trivial things into
    the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module.


Organization & cross-browser support:
    Looked into the current state of affairs in terms of Firefox, and 
    re-organized a bunch of tickets and milestones. Gotta keep thinking in
    baby steps.
