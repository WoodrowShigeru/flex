  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o16-12-o5 ))

Bugfix:
    On the FLEX preferences page, clicking back and forth on
    already "explained" modules falsely closed the explanation
    popup when it shouldn't.

Cross-browser support:
    Tried to set up the FLEX preferences page using the new
    WebExtensions logic in Firefox.


· (( 2o16-12-o3 ))

Bugfix:
    On the FLEX preferences pages, disabled the "Explain this!"
    question-mark button for sub-settings items … since they
    don't have an explanation.


· (( 2o16-11-3o ))

Structure, code cleanup:
    Started overhauling the FLEX preferences page so that it
    supports Chrome's fancy new design layout (which has been
    made necessary for Firefox).


· (( 2o16-11-29 ))

Quality assurance, code cleanup:
    Made an important, kinda final test regarding the format
    conversion of the woodbox and the Quicklinks settings.

Cross-browser support:
    Started porting FLEX from Chrome to Firefox.


· (( 2o16-11-28 ))

New feature (cont.), bugfix:
    Properly set up "Crossreferencing" as a new module.
    
    Finally found the culprit of a recent focus-stealing 
    bug. And fixed that, of course.


· (( 2o16-11-26 ))

Graphic design, new feature (cont.), another new feature:
    Created and implemented a new loading icon.
    
    Expanded the new module "Crossreferencing Episodes"
    before it was even released to support other categories
    as well. It shall be renamed into just "Crossreferencing".
    
    Added a new mandatory feature "Fix Broken Cascaded H2UL
    Groups" and modified the classify() submodule.


· (( 2o16-11-24 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Polished the quick-n-dirty implementation of the new
    "Crossreferencing Episodes" feature.


· (( 2o16-11-22 ))

    Added a new module "Crossreferencing Episodes".
    Developed a working model from scratch.


· (( 2o16-o8-2o ))

Tests, bugfixes, optimizations, structure, new feature (cont.):
    Tested all remaining (old) modules. Updated my category
    filters ("Search-or-Create Filter" and "Recent Pages
    Filter") to handle the new woodbox structure.

    Added handling of renamed modules when updating FLEX.

    Polished the new modules "EAP Highlight Current Tab" 
    and "Clarify Categories" for release.

    Added minor tweaks to the Edit-a-Page environment in 
    the environment analysis. Also added rudimentary 
    environment detection for that fancy new iFrame.


· (( 2o16-o8-13 ))

Tests, bugfix, optimization:
    Tested more modules, from "Paint History" to "EDIT is
    in the Way".

    Found bugs in the "EDIT is in the Way" module, fixed
    them and added more stability to it.


· (( 2o16-o8-11 ))

Bugfix, structure, tests:
    Removed the "don't load from storage if woodbox.loaded"
    logic. It caused bugs and wasn't necessary, anyway.

    changes.


· (( 2o16-o8-o6 ))

Structure, bugfix:
    Repaired the "de/activate all" functionality within the

    accordance to the recent structure changes.

    Dragging".


· (( 2o16-o7-24 ))

Update, structure:
    Repaired the raw functionality of the "Custom Quicklinks"
    module – in the most quick-n-dirt and least elegant way.


· (( 2o16-o7-21 ))

Structure:
    Modified the Options page, modules that have sub settings

    the localStorage.


· (( 2o16-o6-13 ))

Structure (cont.):
    Straightened the module updating/moving mess by reformatting
    localStorage once again (but only a minor change this time).
    Occam's razor.

    First steps towards moving modules (and module parts) to new
    locations.

    modified localStorage-woodbox interface.
