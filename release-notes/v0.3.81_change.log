    First steps towards moving modules (and module parts) to new
    locations.


· (( 2o16-o5-18 ))

Structure (cont.):
    Established and tested slightly different quicklinks structure.

    Made the woodbox load the user preferences from localStorage
    again.


· (( 2o16-o5-16 ))

Code cleanup & structure (cont.):
    Cleaned up the processes of "update localStorage upon
    extension update" and "wake up woodbox upon browser
    startup".

    Made the contentscript receive and evaluate the
    modified localStorage-woodbox interface.

Update & bugfix:
    Added the prevention of an accidental text selection
    to the "Search for Lists" module.

    Also fixed that the accesskey gets lost when switching
    from "search for lists" back to the original search.

    Tweaked the "Fix broken CSS when Viewing a Page" module.

New mini-feature:
    Similarly to "Activate ABC", I've highlighted the 
    current tab in the Edit-a-Page environment.

Structure (cont.):
    More coding on the localStorage-woodbox interface.

    Started coding a reconceptualized, less clutterfull structure
    for the woodbox / localStorage / database situation.

· (( 2o15-11-o8 ))

Optimization:
    Modified "Search for Lists" so that it treats the input as a

    term.
