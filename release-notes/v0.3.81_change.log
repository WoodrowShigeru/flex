· (( 2o16-11-28 ))

New feature (cont.), bugfix:
    Properly set up "Crossreferencing" as a new module.

Graphic design, new feature (cont.), another new feature:
    Created and implemented a new loading icon.
    
    Expanded the new module "Crossreferencing Episodes"
    before it was even released to support other categories

    Groups" and modified the classify() submodule.

    Polished the new modules "EAP Highlight Current Tab" 
    and "Clarify Categories" for release.

    environment detection for that fancy new iFrame.


· (( 2o16-o8-13 ))

Tests, bugfix, optimization:
    Tested more modules, from "Paint History" to "EDIT is
    in the Way".

    Found bugs in the "EDIT is in the Way" module, fixed
    them and added more stability to it.


· (( 2o16-o8-11 ))

Bugfix, structure, tests:
    Removed the "don't load from storage if woodbox.loaded"

    changes.

    Repaired the "de/activate all" functionality within the

    Dragging".


· (( 2o16-o7-24 ))

Update, structure:
    Repaired the raw functionality of the "Custom Quicklinks"
    module – in the most quick-n-dirt and least elegant way.


· (( 2o16-o7-21 ))

Structure:
    Modified the Options page, modules that have sub settings

    the localStorage.


· (( 2o16-o6-13 ))

Structure (cont.):
    Straightened the module updating/moving mess by reformatting
    localStorage once again (but only a minor change this time).
