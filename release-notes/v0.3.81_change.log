  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o16-o8-13 ))

Tests, bugfix, optimization:
    Tested more modules, from "Paint History" to "EDIT is

    Found bugs in the "EDIT is in the Way" module, fixed
    them and added more stability to it.


· (( 2o16-o8-11 ))

Bugfix, structure, tests:
    Removed the "don't load from storage if woodbox.loaded"

    changes.

Structure, bugfix:
    Repaired the "de/activate all" functionality within the

    Dragging".

· (( 2o16-o7-21 ))

Structure:
    Modified the Options page, modules that have sub settings

    the woodbox.

    the localStorage.


· (( 2o16-o6-13 ))

Structure (cont.):
    Straightened the module updating/moving mess by reformatting
    localStorage once again (but only a minor change this time).

    First steps towards moving modules (and module parts) to new
    locations.

    modified localStorage-woodbox interface.

    to the "Search for Lists" module.
