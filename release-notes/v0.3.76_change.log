[[ v0.3.76 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o15-1o-17 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Added a functional pagination system to the module "Search 
    for Lists". With some code optimization here and there
    included.


· (( 2o15-1o-15 ))

New feature (cont.), code cleanup, update:
    Fleshed out the "Assisted Pagination" proof of concept,
    deepened the logic functionality, defined the GUI, and
    did some early stress tests.

    Also updated an older module in the same environment and
    similar functionality with sleeker logic, namely the reset
    of the scrollTop.


· (( 2o15-1o-14 ))

New feature:
    Added a new feature for the Edit-a-List environment,
    letting users browse the left list in steps via clicks,
    rather than with the mousewheel or the awkward slimScroll:
    "Assisted Pagination". As a proof of concept, for now.


· (( 2o15-1o-12 ))

Bugfix:
    Fixed the new Preview Pane (when editing a List) showing
    up if browsing a short list, and not re-appearing after
    a non-drag click.

    Also fixed a bug where the other new module, "Search for
    Lists" didn't seem to work on certain parts of FL.


· (( 2o15-1o-1o ))

New feature (cont.):
    Added optimizations, convenience, and more to the
    "Search for Lists" module.


· (( 2o15-1o-o9 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Rebuilt the quick'n'dirty placeholder GUI with a proper 
    GUI for the new "Search for Lists" module. Also cleaned
    its code.


· (( 2o15-1o-o8 ))

Bugfix:
    Fixed the bug in the new list search where the form was
    submitted twice.


· (( 2o15-1o-o7 ))

New feature:
    Implemented a functionality to search for lists. Merely 
    the logic – though functional!


· (( 2o15-1o-o6 ))

Quality assurance, finalization:
    Continued with the newest module, the preview pane. Grab
    "category", too. Bugfixes. More styling. Stress tests.
    Preferences integration. Animated explain-image.

Bugfix, minor update:
    Slightly modified the "Article Readability" module.

Structure:
    Modified the options script so that individual stylings
    for the explain-images becomes possible.

Bugfix:
    Quick-fixed the YouTube video-ID recognition submodule
    for youtu.be-links (which now exclusively use https).


· (( 2o15-1o-o5 ))

Structure:
    Tried a trival optimization of the environment detection.
    
New feature:
    Added a preview pane in the Edit-a-List environment for
    a way bigger image, a way more prominent representation
    when hovering over the list items.


· (( 2o15-o6-17 ))

Bugfix:
    Trivial improvement to the "Provide Preview" module,
    prevented overlaying texts with long titles.



· (( 2o15-o5-12 ))

Update:
    Trivial improvement to the "Quicken Date Paste" module,
    using the placeholder attribute for ‹input›.



· (( 2o15-o5-1o ))

Bugfix:
    Fixed the "gender to category" module which had stopped 
    working at some point.
