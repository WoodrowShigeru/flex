[[ v0.3.72 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o15-o1-o8 ))

Cross-browser support & bugfix:
    Ported over yesterday's Chrome bugfix of "Categorize Edit-a-List"
    to Firefox.

    Fixed the sorting of my Filter modules ("Search or Create" and
    "Recent Pages") not affecting both. Fixed in both, Chrome and
    Firefox. Also, got rid of an accidentally produced error 
    message.

    Quality Assurance in Firefox for the final stretch of modules.



· (( 2o15-o1-o6 ))

Cross-browser support & bugfix:
    Fixed the crappy design bug after using the "Categorize Edit-a-List" 
    module and then ranking something. Fixed in Chrome.

    Quality Assurance for modules of the Browse-Lists, Edit-a-List and
    forum environment in Firefox.


Structure:
    This version kinda arose blendingly with v0.3.71, the only
    difference being bugfixes.
