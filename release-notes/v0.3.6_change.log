[[ v0.3.6 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o5-29 ))

Bugfixes, cross-browser support & publish:
    Stress tests and bug fixes for several recently touched modules. Opera 
    synchronization.



· (( 2o14-o5-27 ))

Code optimization:
    Encapuselated a redundant part of the "Quicken Date Paste" module. Added a 
    sub-feature to also cover incomplete user input (i.e. only a year).



· (( 2o14-o5-26 ))

Code optimization & new feature:
    Polished the "Quicken Date Paste" module and implemented a tease for an already 
    planned update.



· (( 2o14-o5-25 ))

Code structure:
    Re-modeled the Opera-specific content script. Now with less redundancy. Tried to
    improve the naming convention system for my modules.


Bugfix:
    Made the scrolling in the "Highlight Timestamps" module work in both Chrome & Opera.



· (( 2o14-o5-24 ))

Code optimization, cross-browser-support & bugfix attempt:
    Cleaned up and improved the code for the "Highlight Timestamps" module. Tried to 
    fix a Chrome-Opera-cross-browser-related scrolling issue.


Bugfix & cross-browser support:
    Repaired the Opera version of the "Expand Recent Lists" module.



· (( 2o14-o5-23 ))

New feature:
    Partially set up / repaired the import|export settings.


Code structure & cross-browser support:
    Unexpectedly optimized the localStorage handling *even further* via a more 
    abstract and less browser-specific approach. Re-coded the preferences page, for 
    ultimate cross-browser compatibility. Got the Opera version up to speed, with 
    minor bugs left.


Code optimization:
    Optimized the "Toggle Spoiler title" module to also cover spoiler links that are 
    added much later (i.e. in activity feed).



· (( 2o14-o5-22 ))

Code optimization:
    Overhauled the "fix forum timestamps / anchor consider menu" module. … Meh, these
    names are terrible.


Code structure:
    Stress tests complete and install/update routine finally sorted out. Also sorted out 
    the Chrome extension packaging, while I was at it.



· (( 2o14-o5-2o ))

New feature:
    Injectingly added access keys.


Code structure:
    Finally implemented a proper way to update the localStorage with new preferences upon
    a fresh installation or update of FLEX.


New feature:
    Minor CSS tweak of my own CSS for the latest "highlight followup forum page" feature.



· (( 2o14-o5-19 ))

Code structure:
    Clarified the circumstances and created an even simpler, even more elegant solution.
    The woodbox is now at the right state at the right time at the right locations.
    Halfway there!



· (( 2o14-o5-18 ))

Code structure:
    Managed to synchronize with localStorage at the right time, but so far only in a
    test environment.


Bugfix:
    Kirk & co. added a new feature a few weeks ago, including a new "Embed" button which 
    screwed up my "Self Jumper" module a bit. I fixed that.


· (( 2o14-o5-15 ))

New feature:
    CSS triviality. I always overlook that there are follow-up thread pages whenever 
    I follow a "subscribed thread" notification.



· (( 2o14-o5-12 ))

Update:
    Elegantly optimized the code for, and finished, the "Expand Recent Lists" module.



· (( 2o14-o5-11 ))

Update & bugfix:
    Polished, fixed and optimized the code for the "Expand Recent Lists" module. That was
    one trivial-looking but stubborn bug, I might add. Stress tests.



· (( 2o14-o5-1o ))

Update:
    Super minor optimization of the module "Quicken Date Paste".



· (( 2o14-o5-o8 ))

Update:
    Implemented a way to inject the next three *only if* the right-arrow-click "hits the
    right border" of loaded elements.



· (( 2o14-o5-o7 ))

Development workflow:
    Got into GitHub.  https://github.com/WoodrowShigeru/flex


Update:
    Re-addressed the styling and DOM structure of the arrows of the "Expand Recent Lists"
    module.



· (( 2o14-o5-o4 ))

Cross-browser support:
    More synchronization from Chrome to Opera.



· (( 2o14-o5-o3 ))

Bugfix & cross-browser support:
    Successfully repaired the Opera version. Back to synchronization.



· (( 2o14-o5-o2 ))

Code structure:
    Tested a potential new method to synchronize an existing localStorage with brand-new
    preferences.



· (( 2o14-o5-o1 ))

Update:
    Implemented a three-at-once intermediate solution for the Recent Lists list which, up
    until now, showed either only three or *all* lists.


New feature:
    Quicken Date Paste. Translate and insert any date string information into the three
    respective fields at once.


Update:
    New HTML styling for the "category tree" module.



· (( 2o14-o4-3o ))

Update & code optimization:
    Re-addressed the "category tree" module (when editing a Page) to handle the new
    element design. And also, to tweak it a little.


Code cleanup:
    "Officialized" some recent modules, without initially planned cross-browser
    synchronization.


Bugfix:
    Excluded FLEX from running on jpg files and the like.
