[[ v0.3.5 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o4-29 ))

Bugfix:
    Quicklinks Customization was not working nicely upon a fresh FLEX installation.


Publish:
    Stress tests before publishing.


Structure optimization:
    Learned how to package my Chrome extension.


New feature:
    Provided checkboxes as options/preferences for my latest modules.


New feature:
    Finished the "fix timestamp displacement" module. At least enough to be published.



· (( 2o14-o4-28 ))

Bugfix (attempt):
    Several attempts of fixing the suddenly inexplicably broken-again Opera version.
    Somehow the config.xml file became unreadable.



· (( 2o14-o4-26 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Returned to attempting to fix jQuery in Opera. … Success! Beginning synchronization
    with Chrome's state of affairs.



· (( 2o14-o4-25 ))

Update:
    Figured out how to replace the current quicklink radioboxes with dynamically created
    ones based on a numeric array. Implementation. And I can FINALLY say that I concluded
    the rough lion's share of the Customize Quicklinks module, now in (still buggy, but
    nevertheless) epic drag & drop fashion!


Update:
    Created procedure concepts for localStorage synchronization as well as the Custom
    Quicklinks feature.


New feature:
    Created a jsFiddle in order to dig into the trouble I'm having with the forum
    timestamp gimmick effect.



· (( 2o14-o4-24 ))

New feature:
    Tried to add a gimmick effect to the "fix forum timestamp displacement" feature.


Styling:
    Tweaked the appearance of the preferences/options page.


Code optimization:
    … mmmh nng … D'OH! *slaps forehead* I found a WAY easier method to execute EVERYTHING
    about this left|right browsing module (›‹ )  Finished module, clean up and stress
    test.


Bugfix:
    There are some usability cases where the left|right browsing feature should not be
    fired.



· (( 2o14-o4-23 ))

Update:
    Made the left|right browsing feature successfully identify valid and invalid
    environments in most cases.


Code cleanup:
    Finalized the new Spoiler-toggling module.



· (( 2o14-o4-22 ))

New feature:
    Started another fixing triviality, forum timestamp displacement due to the menu bar,
    but then I figured that instead of creating a new module, this could be fixed in the
    original FL script.


New feature:
    Another triviality: made the Spoiler links say "Hide" instead of "Show" when they're
    opened.


Update:
    Played around with regular expressions in order to identify valid and invalid
    environments for my left|right browsing feature.


Structure optimization:
    Tried to get my head around when and how to get and set all available instances of
    each of my "preferences".



· (( 2o14-o4-21 ))

Code cleanup:
    Official implementation, stress test, cleanup and optimization of the left|right
    browsing feature. Started to expand this to all types of numbered pages— GOD! This
    awful terminology!


New feature:
    Quite trivial. A mini CSS fix when viewing a Page.


Debug:
    Redirected the background page's console logs to somewhere where I can actually read
    them.


Update:
    Quicklinks Customization: Successfully saved the dropped quicklinks in the
    localStorage.



· (( 2o14-o4-2o ))

Graphic design:
    Created more icons in a style matching the previously introduced question marks.


New feature:
    Continued a bit on the "Import|Export Preferences" functionality. Transport from/to
    dedicated box with rudimentary styling.



· (( 2o14-o4-18 ))

New feature:
    Expanded the Recent Lists list to be greater than three. … Quite greater.


Code cleanup:
    Tidied up yesterday's changes (and continued the changing) in the preferences page
    script. And made the HTML code so god-damn beautiful! Got rid of the redundancies
    and moved the code-convoluting explanations elsewhere.



· (( 2o14-o4-17 ))

Styling & code optimization:
    Re-designed the preferences page and re-structured its JavaScript. I didn't know
    before how I could implement jQuery here.


Graphic design:
    Created several versions of a question mark icon until I found one that I liked.


Update:
    Made the Quicklinks Customization feature load the custom Quicklinks that are saved
    in the localStorage. At least in my own setup menu. Tried to save the user selection.



· (( 2o14-o4-15 ))

Update:
    Solved the messaging/timing problem for the Quicklinks Customization feature.



· (( 2o14-o4-13 ))

Update:
    Achieved reliable bi-directional dropping events for the Quicklinks Customization.



· (( 2o14-o4-12 ))

Update:
    Stabilized the dragging experience of the Quicklinks Customization.


Code cleanup:
    Used less confusing localStorage values for my preferences.



· (( 2o14-o4-1o ))

New feature:
    Began work on "Import|Export Preferences".


Bugfix attempt:
    Looking into that "re-installing FLEX doesn't properly load the user's custom
    preferences" bug.



· (( 2o14-o4-o8 ))

Update:
    Quicklinks Customization now uses drag & drop. I've made it work so that the mouse
    click picks up the correct item.



eof.
