Bugfix:
    Fixed the "Categorize EAL" module that was destroyed since 
    Favsland's newest updates to the Edit-a-List environment 
    (thumbnail, etc.). Fixed most of it, anyway.


Bugfix:
    Fixed the "Provide Preview" link being hidden by the new
    thumbnail in the Edit-a-List environment.


Update:
    Updated the "Quicken Date Paste" module so that it can cope
    with numerical months. And also added German and French
    support.
