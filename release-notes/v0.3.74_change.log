Update, bugfix, cross-browser support & release:
    Fixed the "Expand Recent Lists" module so that it can cope
    with the official version.
    
    Also fixed a few bugs, i.e. I deactivated the experimental
    new modules, before releasing this for Firefox & Chrome.

Trivial new feature:
    Moved the EDIT etc. options line that appears in activity 
    comment posts further down. QA.
