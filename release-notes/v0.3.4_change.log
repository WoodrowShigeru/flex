[[ v0.3.4 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o4-o8 ))

Code optimization:
    Enhanced the  retrieve_YouTube_id()  module to also allow iFrame embeds. … Okay,
    I admit it. I'm showing off a bit now ;^)


Bugfix:
    Quicken YouTube Paste messed with the user experience of the simple text field
    functionalities. I also tried to create a custom "on-paste" event but … things
    got complicated. So I put that out again.


New feature:
    Succeeded in disabling the automation of the Happening Now box.



· (( 2o14-o4-o5 ))

Code cleanup:
    Stylesheet injection.


New feature:
    Tried to disable the aggressively annoying slideshow automation of the brand-new
    Happening Now box.



· (( 2o14-o4-o4 ))

Update:
    Continued work on the new Quicklinks Customization. CSS styling and setting up a
    Quicklinks save system with localStorage.



· (( 2o14-o3-31 ))

Code structure:
    Tried changing the structure to use RequireJS.



· (( 2o14-o3-3o ))

Bugfix (attempt):
    The Opera version is broken, every now and then any search will yield no results
    whatsoever, even if not a single module is activated. Wrong jQuery implementation …



eof.
