Organization:
    Archived change.log segments of published releases. From this moment onwards, 
    this file shall be exclusively for new content!


New feature (cont.):
    Finished the 2-step hide aka "custom fold" of the "Quicken Album Tracklist" 
    module.


New feature (cont.) & optimization:
    Prettified the user experience regarding the "Track++" module, if the
    environment is loaded up with an empty tracklist. Also stress tests.



· (( 2o14-1o-o7 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Began to remove some annoyance and at the same time add a little bit more 
    elegance to the "Album Tracklist" module.



· (( 2o14-o9-3o ))

Graphic design, new feature (cont.), code optimization & code cleanup:
    Created my necessary neat little graphic and finalized the Pause 
    functionality of my "Track++" module. And tidied up.



· (( 2o14-o9-29 ))

Organization:
    Moved my next version of the "Stop Happening" module from FLEX v3.7 to v3.8
    – in order to speed things up a little.


New feature (cont.):
    Vastly simplified the "Track++" module. Also, started work on an additional
    "Pause|Unpause Track++" feature (at will).


New feature (cont.):
    Marked some trivial modules as "ready" that have been in stress tests so far.



· (( 2o14-o9-19 ))

Update / code cleanup:
    Tried to finalize the "Fix YouTube Overlay" module – but it has become
    obsolete! The issue is no more.



· (( 2o14-o9-11 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Tried to make the "Force click Brands n Users" module work. No success.


Update & code optimization:
    Checked out the "YouTube overlay bugfix" but I can't reproduce the initial

New feature (cont.):
    Stress tested and finalized the Edit-a-Page (EAP) Submit button modification
    module.



· (( 2o14-o9-o6 ))

Trivial new feature:
    Made the category say "Actor" or "Actress", respectively, instead of 
    "Actor/Actress". (only when on a Page).



· (( 2o14-o8-16 ))

Bugfix, new feature (cont.):
    As JavaScript equals "null +1 === 1" to true, the initial state of the
    "Track++" module didn't work with "1" as a starting point.


Graphic design:
    Updated the Chrome extension logo of FLEX a little bit with rounded corners.


Bugfix, new feature (cont.):
    My new mb_preview buttons in the edit-a-page environment weren't showing
    on the music album tracklist category-tab. Code cleanup, too.



· (( 2o14-o8-11 ))

New feature (attempt):
    Tried to auto-select "Users+Brands" in the brand page environment. But 
    failed.


New feature (cont.):
    Fixed a CSS bug for the "Album Tracklist" module.



· (( 2o14-o8-1o ))

New feature (cont.):
    Continuing work on a feature I started months ago, the miniboxes in an
    Edit-a-Page environment search are now clickable like *outside* that 
    environment – *while* maintaining the "select-to-add" functionality.



· (( 2o14-o8-o9 ))

New feature:
    In the "Edit a Page" environment, I made a – what I think – better 
    version of the "Update" submit button. Now there is no need to have
    two of them.



· (( 2o14-o8-o4 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Restructured, repaired the sorting and then finalized the "Release Date" 
    part of the "SorFilCat" module. (Basically).



· (( 2o14-o8-o2 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Repaired the buggy reset functionality of the "SorFilCat" module and 
    made the sorting routine work.



· (( 2o14-o7-31 ))

New feature (attempt):
    Tried to add thumbnails to the "quick-tag" feature, like I do with the
    "Detect Duplicates" module. But the "quick-tag" feature is broken as 
    hell.



· (( 2o14-o7-28 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Established the "Track++" module, making it easier to add tracks to 
    albums. Implemented the core functionality.

New feature:
    When Editing a Page, change categories via ALT + PageUp | PageDown.



· (( 2o14-o7-2o ))

New feature (cont.):
    Code cleanup of "SorFilCat", added target functionality i.e. "Filter by 
    Device Types".



· (( 2o14-o7-19 ))

Graphic design and implementation:
    Goofing around, hijackingly ;^D


Trivial new feature:
    Fixed the broken styling for admins of fan pages. I'm talking about the
    unintended horizontal scrollbar that appears if you hover over the brand
    header.



· (( 2o14-o7-1o ))

New feature (cont.):
    Continued "SorFilCat", fill the manufacturer's list dynamically and react
    appropriately to user selections in the range of "Filter by Manufacturer".



· (( 2o14-o7-o7 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Continued "SorFilCat", data retrieval busy work, more acceptable styling.



· (( 2o14-o7-o6 ))

New feature:
    Started a new module called "Sort/Filter/Categorize Lists", referring to the
    lists of gaming platforms. Injection, conceptualization, data collection.



· (( 2o14-o6-29 ))

Structure:
    Trivial change, reduced redundancy in the code.
    


· (( 2o14-o6-16 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Continued working on a long-planned feature which I started ages ago, the 
    "Previewable Miniboxes in Edit a Page environment" module. Successfully 
    injected a functioning link that provides the feature, but injection doesn't 
    happen automatically yet.



· (( 2o14-o6-14 ))

New feature (cont.):
    Enhanced the tracklist processing routine in the "Album Tracklist" module. Now
    it can detect invalid lines and remove unwelcome side information. Also 
    implemented "get out of the way" management.


· (( 2o14-o6-o9 ))

Bugfix:
    Re-addressed some older modules, such as "Detect Duplicates", and fixed various 
    trivialities.


New feature (cont.):
    Implemented a functioning method to paste an album tracklist for that module.
    
    

· (( 2o14-o6-o8 ))

Update:
    Added a new AccessKey to enhance the "Quicken Date Paste" module.
    

New feature:
    Started developing the previously planned "Track++" module. Got the number right
    but cannot hook up the click event. (What's wrong?)
    

New feature (cont.):
    Tested parts of the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module's procedure with a test run.
    Tried to fire the search via  .keyup()  but no luck yet.



· (( 2o14-o6-o4 ))

New feature:
    Started a new module "Quicken Album Tracklist", in order to speed up the creation
    process of an album's individual songs. Mostly did just styling and structure
    today, though.


    
· (( 2o14-o6-o3 ))

Update:
    Re-addressed the "Self Jumper" module, added a jumper from someone's list to the
    combined chart, removed buttons that didn't make sense.



· (( 2o14-o5-31 ))

New feature:
    Quickfix quick-n-dirty implementation of a new feature/module: "prevent the 
    horizontal thumbnail bar from resetting when manually sorting a ranking list".
