  ________
[[ v0.3.6 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o7-o7 ))

New feature:
    Continued "SorFilCat", data retrieval busy work, more acceptable styling.



· (( 2o14-o7-o6 ))

New feature:
    Started a new module called "Sort/Filter/Categorize Lists", referring to the
    lists of gaming platforms. Injection, conceptualization, data collection.



· (( 2o14-o6-29 ))

Structure:
    Trivial change, reduced redundancy in the code.
    


· (( 2o14-o6-16 ))

New feature:
    Continued working on a long-planned feature which I started ages ago, the 
    "Previewable Miniboxes in Edit a Page environment" module. Successfully 
    injected a functioning link that provides the feature, but injection doesn't 
    happen automatic yet.



· (( 2o14-o6-14 ))

New feature:
    Enhanced the tracklist processing routine in the "Album Tracklist" module. Now
    it can detect invalid lines and remove unwelcome side information. Also 
    implemented "get out of the way" management.


· (( 2o14-o6-o9 ))

Bugfix:
    Re-addressed some older modules, such as "Detect Duplicates", and fixed various 
    trivialities.


New feature:
    Implemented a functioning method to paste an album tracklist for that module.
    
    

· (( 2o14-o6-o8 ))

Update:
    Added a new AccessKey to enhance the "Quicken Date Paste" module.
    

New feature:
    Started developing the previously planned "Track++" module. Got the number right
    but cannot hook up the click event. (What's wrong?)
    

New feature (cont.):
    Tested parts of the "Quicken Album Tracklist" module's procedure with a test run.
    Tried to fire the search via  .keyup()  but no luck yet.



· (( 2o14-o6-o4 ))

New feature:
    Started a new module "Quicken Album Tracklist", in order to speed up the creation
    process of an album's individual songs. Mostly did just styling and structure
    today, though.


    
· (( 2o14-o6-o3 ))

Update:
    Re-addressed the "Self Jumper" module, added a jumper from someone's list to the
    combined chart, removed buttons that didn't make sense.



· (( 2o14-o5-31 ))

New feature:
    Quickfix quick-n-dirty implementation of a new feature/module: "prevent the 
    horizontal thumbnail bar from resetting when manually sorting a ranking list".



· (( 2o14-o5-29 ))

Bugfixes, cross-browser support & publish:
    Stress tests and bug fixes for several recently touched modules. Opera 
    synchronization.



· (( 2o14-o5-27 ))

Code optimization:
    Encapuselated a redundant part of the "Quicken Date Paste" module. Added a 
    sub-feature to also cover incomplete user input (i.e. only a year).



· (( 2o14-o5-26 ))

Code optimization & new feature:
    Polished the "Quicken Date Paste" module and implemented a tease for an already 
    planned update.



· (( 2o14-o5-25 ))

Code structure:
    Re-modeled the Opera-specific content script. Now with less redundancy. Tried to
    improve the naming convention system for my modules.


Bugfix:
    Made the scrolling in the "Highlight Timestamps" module work in both Chrome & Opera.



· (( 2o14-o5-24 ))

Code optimization, cross-browser-support & bugfix attempt:
    Cleaned up and improved the code for the "Highlight Timestamps" module. Tried to 
    fix a Chrome-Opera-cross-browser-related scrolling issue.


Bugfix & cross-browser support:
    Repaired the Opera version of the "Expand Recent Lists" module.



· (( 2o14-o5-23 ))

New feature:
    Partially set up / repaired the import|export settings.


Code structure & cross-browser support:
    Unexpectedly optimized the localStorage handling *even further* via a more 
    abstract and less browser-specific approach. Re-coded the preferences page, for 
    ultimate cross-browser compatibility. Got the Opera version up to speed, with 
    minor bugs left.


Code optimization:
    Optimized the "Toggle Spoiler title" module to also cover spoiler links that are 
    added much later (i.e. in activity feed).



· (( 2o14-o5-22 ))

Code optimization:
    Overhauled the "fix forum timestamps / anchor consider menu" module. … Meh, these
    names are terrible.


Code structure:
    Stress tests complete and install/update routine finally sorted out. Also sorted out 
    the Chrome extension packaging, while I was at it.



· (( 2o14-o5-2o ))

New feature:
    Injectingly added access keys.


Code structure:
    Finally implemented a proper way to update the localStorage with new preferences upon
    a fresh installation or update of FLEX.


New feature:
    Minor CSS tweak of my own CSS for the latest "highlight followup forum page" feature.



· (( 2o14-o5-19 ))

Code structure:
    Clarified the circumstances and created an even simpler, even more elegant solution.
    The woodbox is now at the right state at the right time at the right locations.
    Halfway there!



· (( 2o14-o5-18 ))

Code structure:
    Managed to synchronize with localStorage at the right time, but so far only in a
    test environment.


Bugfix:
    Kirk & co. added a new feature a few weeks ago, including a new "Embed" button which 
    screwed up my "Self Jumper" module a bit. I fixed that.


· (( 2o14-o5-15 ))

New feature:
    CSS triviality. I always overlook that there are follow-up thread pages whenever 
    I follow a "subscribed thread" notification.



· (( 2o14-o5-12 ))

Update:
    Elegantly optimized the code for, and finished, the "Expand Recent Lists" module.



· (( 2o14-o5-11 ))

Update & bugfix:
    Polished, fixed and optimized the code for the "Expand Recent Lists" module. That was
    one trivial-looking but stubborn bug, I might add. Stress tests.



· (( 2o14-o5-1o ))

Update:
    Super minor optimization of the module "Quicken Date Paste".



· (( 2o14-o5-o8 ))

Update:
    Implemented a way to inject the next three *only if* the right-arrow-click "hits the
    right border" of loaded elements.



· (( 2o14-o5-o7 ))

Development workflow:
    Got into GitHub.  https://github.com/WoodrowShigeru/flex


Update:
    Re-addressed the styling and DOM structure of the arrows of the "Expand Recent Lists"
    module.



· (( 2o14-o5-o4 ))

Cross-browser support:
    More synchronization from Chrome to Opera.



· (( 2o14-o5-o3 ))

Bugfix & cross-browser support:
    Successfully repaired the Opera version. Back to synchronization.



· (( 2o14-o5-o2 ))

Code structure:
    Tested a potential new method to synchronize an existing localStorage with brand-new
    preferences.



· (( 2o14-o5-o1 ))

Update:
    Implemented a three-at-once intermediate solution for the Recent Lists list which, up
    until now, showed either only three or *all* lists.


New feature:
    Quicken Date Paste. Translate and insert any date string information into the three
    respective fields at once.


Update:
    New HTML styling for the "category tree" module.



· (( 2o14-o4-3o ))

Update & code optimization:
    Re-addressed the "category tree" module (when editing a Page) to handle the new
    element design. And also, to tweak it a little.


Code cleanup:
    "Officialized" some recent modules, without initially planned cross-browser
    synchronization.


Bugfix:
    Excluded FLEX from running on jpg files and the like.



  ________
[[ v0.3.5 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o4-29 ))

Bugfix:
    Quicklinks Customization was not working nicely upon a fresh FLEX installation.


Publish:
    Stress tests before publishing.


Structure optimization:
    Learned how to package my Chrome extension.


New feature:
    Provided checkboxes as options/preferences for my latest modules.


New feature:
    Finished the "fix timestamp displacement" module. At least enough to be published.



· (( 2o14-o4-28 ))

Bugfix (attempt):
    Several attempts of fixing the suddenly inexplicably broken-again Opera version.
    Somehow the config.xml file became unreadable.



· (( 2o14-o4-26 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Returned to attempting to fix jQuery in Opera. … Success! Beginning synchronization
    with Chrome's state of affairs.



· (( 2o14-o4-25 ))

Update:
    Figured out how to replace the current quicklink radioboxes with dynamically created
    ones based on a numeric array. Implementation. And I can FINALLY say that I concluded
    the rough lion's share of the Customize Quicklinks module, now in (still buggy, but
    nevertheless) epic drag & drop fashion!


Update:
    Created procedure concepts for localStorage synchronization as well as the Custom
    Quicklinks feature.


New feature:
    Created a jsFiddle in order to dig into the trouble I'm having with the forum
    timestamp gimmick effect.



· (( 2o14-o4-24 ))

New feature:
    Tried to add a gimmick effect to the "fix forum timestamp displacement" feature.


Styling:
    Tweaked the appearance of the preferences/options page.


Code optimization:
    … mmmh nng … D'OH! *slaps forehead* I found a WAY easier method to execute EVERYTHING
    about this left|right browsing module (›‹ )  Finished module, clean up and stress
    test.


Bugfix:
    There are some usability cases where the left|right browsing feature should not be
    fired.



· (( 2o14-o4-23 ))

Update:
    Made the left|right browsing feature successfully identify valid and invalid
    environments in most cases.


Code cleanup:
    Finalized the new Spoiler-toggling module.



· (( 2o14-o4-22 ))

New feature:
    Started another fixing triviality, forum timestamp displacement due to the menu bar,
    but then I figured that instead of creating a new module, this could be fixed in the
    original FL script.


New feature:
    Another triviality: made the Spoiler links say "Hide" instead of "Show" when they're
    opened.


Update:
    Played around with regular expressions in order to identify valid and invalid
    environments for my left|right browsing feature.


Structure optimization:
    Tried to get my head around when and how to get and set all available instances of
    each of my "preferences".



· (( 2o14-o4-21 ))

Code cleanup:
    Official implementation, stress test, cleanup and optimization of the left|right
    browsing feature. Started to expand this to all types of numbered pages— GOD! This
    awful terminology!


New feature:
    Quite trivial. A mini CSS fix when viewing a Page.


Debug:
    Redirected the background page's console logs to somewhere where I can actually read
    them.


Update:
    Quicklinks Customization: Successfully saved the dropped quicklinks in the
    localStorage.



· (( 2o14-o4-2o ))

Graphic design:
    Created more icons in a style matching the previously introduced question marks.


New feature:
    Continued a bit on the "Import|Export Preferences" functionality. Transport from/to
    dedicated box with rudimentary styling.



· (( 2o14-o4-18 ))

New feature:
    Expanded the Recent Lists list to be greater than three. … Quite greater.


Code cleanup:
    Tidied up yesterday's changes (and continued the changing) in the preferences page
    script. And made the HTML code so god-damn beautiful! Got rid of the redundancies
    and moved the code-convoluting explanations elsewhere.



· (( 2o14-o4-17 ))

Styling & code optimization:
    Re-designed the preferences page and re-structured its JavaScript. I didn't know
    before how I could implement jQuery here.


Graphic design:
    Created several versions of a question mark icon until I found one that I liked.


Update:
    Made the Quicklinks Customization feature load the custom Quicklinks that are saved
    in the localStorage. At least in my own setup menu. Tried to save the user selection.



· (( 2o14-o4-15 ))

Update:
    Solved the messaging/timing problem for the Quicklinks Customization feature.



· (( 2o14-o4-13 ))

Update:
    Achieved reliable bi-directional dropping events for the Quicklinks Customization.



· (( 2o14-o4-12 ))

Update:
    Stabilized the dragging experience of the Quicklinks Customization.


Code cleanup:
    Used less confusing localStorage values for my preferences.



· (( 2o14-o4-1o ))

New feature:
    Began work on "Import|Export Preferences".


Bugfix attempt:
    Looking into that "re-installing FLEX doesn't properly load the user's custom
    preferences" bug.



· (( 2o14-o4-o8 ))

Update:
    Quicklinks Customization now uses drag & drop. I've made it work so that the mouse
    click picks up the correct item.



  ________
[[ v0.3.4 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o4-o8 ))

Code optimization:
    Enhanced the  retrieve_YouTube_id()  module to also allow iFrame embeds. … Okay,
    I admit it. I'm showing off a bit now ;^)


Bugfix:
    Quicken YouTube Paste messed with the user experience of the simple text field
    functionalities. I also tried to create a custom "on-paste" event but … things
    got complicated. So I put that out again.


New feature:
    Succeeded in disabling the automation of the Happening Now box.



· (( 2o14-o4-o5 ))

Code cleanup:
    Stylesheet injection.


New feature:
    Tried to disable the aggressively annoying slideshow automation of the brand-new
    Happening Now box.



· (( 2o14-o4-o4 ))

Update:
    Continued work on the new Quicklinks Customization. CSS styling and setting up a
    Quicklinks save system with localStorage.



· (( 2o14-o3-31 ))

Code structure:
    Tried changing the structure to use RequireJS.



· (( 2o14-o3-3o ))

Bugfix (attempt):
    The Opera version is broken, every now and then any search will yield no results
    whatsoever, even if not a single module is activated. Wrong jQuery implementation …



  ________
[[ v0.3.3 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o3-29 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Synchronized the individual development states of Opera and Chrome.


Bugfix (attempt) & code cleanup:
    The general search feature seemed suddenly broken in Opera. Also, tried to optimize
    the jQuery implementation.



· (( 2o14-o3-28 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Got back into Firefox development. (It's so *different* …) Worked my way through
    several tutorials and documentations. Set up the manifest and xul-files. First
    packaging & installation attempts.


Cross-browser support:
    Split up the full package file for version 0.3.2 into separate entities for the
    individual browsers and reserved an online location for future uploads.



· (( 2o14-o3-27 ))

Update:
    Started creating a vastly improved user customization of the quicklinks.



· (( 2o14-o3-26 ))

Code optimization (attempt):
    Attempted (but failed) to optimize the module-loading in Chrome. Cannot iterate in
    a for-loop and avoid redundancy. 'twas worth a try.


Graphic design:
    Minorly updated the FLEX banner.


Bugfix:
    At times, Chrome failed to inject my script soon enough to catch the on-load-train.
    That's because I used false jQuery implementation. Now it should be fixed for good.


Update:
    Implemented a newer version of jQuery, 1.11.0, and also figured out better jQuery
    implementation.



· (( 2o14-o3-18 ))

Bugfix:
    My aspect-ratio fix erroneously affected honorable mentions, too.



· (( 2o14-o2-25 ))

New feature:
    Fix broken thumbnail aspect ratio. GODDAMNIT, FINALLY! That has been annoying me since
    my first month on unikGamer. ("View someone's list" only).


New feature:
    Fix the long-ass Eligibility box whose faulty design has become super obvious with
    the newest list "Inspirational People".


Cross-browser support:
    Working on the Firefox developer environment.



· (( 2o14-o2-13 ))

Bugfix:
    The background script of my preferences page was actually called on *any* web page.
    Instead of just the preferences page itself. This only happened in Opera.



· (( 2o14-o2-12 ))

New feature:
    Enable navigating through the Recent Pages via the left|right arrow keys.


Bugfix:
    Fixed my feature "lose focus on submit" which wasn't working for input and textarea
    elements.


Bugfix:
    Fixed browser detection in my preferences page (Opera and Chrome).


New feature:
    Submit forms with enter key (in Chrome, too, like you can in Opera *by default*).


Bugfind:
    Ugh! I was wrong. It's still unfixed, that Chrome-script-loading issue. Trying
    (and failing) to reproduce it.



· (( 2o14-o2-11 ))

Bugfix (attempt):
    Sometimes my script was called too late – when the document was already loaded – and
    thus, failing to inject my modules, making it seem like the modules themselves were
    buggy. (affected Chrome only)


Bugfix:
    Always focusing the first text field (when editing a Page) deemed to be an unwise
    choice (on the category "fictional character" it would always focus the YouTube field
    at the bottom, resulting in an unwanted scroll-jump). I've enhanced the functionality
    to also consider comboboxes of interest.



  ________
[[ v0.3.2 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o14-o2-o8 ))

Graphic design:
    Overhauled the logo.


Description:
    Added more textual explanations for my features.


Cross-browser support:
    Quick-n-dirtily synched Chrome's script structure with Opera's. Rudimentary feature
    tests.



· (( 2o14-o2-o6 ))

Graphic design:
    Created a better textual and visual explanation for some more of my features.


Cross-browser support:
    Add-on Builder for Firefox will soon be retired. Started setting up a new and
    different type of developer environment.



· (( 2o14-o2-o5 ))

Code cleanup:
    Implemented a favicon command for my preferences page. Further synched Opera's and
    Chrome's preferences code, manifest file and general file structure.


New feature:
    Quick-n-dirtily implemented a fix for the YouTube overlay issue (in Opera).



· (( 2o14-o2-o2 ))

Graphic design:
    Created a better textual and visual explanation for half of my features.


Bugfix:
    Showing the visual explanation in my preferences window flickers due to suboptimal
    onmouseout-event-handling.


Styling:
    Re-designed the preferences page.



· (( 2o14-o2-o1 ))

Graphic design:
    Created a new extension logo.


Code cleanup:
    Smartfully slimmened (›‹ ) … the background code for the preferences logic. And now
    I can use the exact same code for both, Opera and Chrome, for faster and more elegant
    cross-browser-coding.


Bugfix:
    On-mouse-over search results of mega-meta-master search caused an error if a ‹li›
    other than li.result was being hovered (i.e. category header such as "People").


New Feature:
    Fixed broken submit of mega-meta-master search = block improper redirect to front page.
    And at the same time, rather auto-redirect to the corresponding Page if the current
    search yields exactly one search result.


Code cleanup:
     Created module.js, proper ordered segmentation of funcs, nice separator comments.
     Further synched Opera and Chrome versions. Added a change.log file.



  ________
[[ v0.3.1 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

(the change.log didn't exist yet)



eof.
