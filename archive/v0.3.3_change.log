[[ v0.3.3 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
· (( 2o14-o3-29 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Synchronized the individual development states of Opera and Chrome.


Bugfix (attempt) & code cleanup:
    The general search feature seemed suddenly broken in Opera. Also, tried to optimize
    the jQuery implementation.



· (( 2o14-o3-28 ))

Cross-browser support:
    Got back into Firefox development. (It's so *different* …) Worked my way through
    several tutorials and documentations. Set up the manifest and xul-files. First
    packaging & installation attempts.


Cross-browser support:
    Split up the full package file for version 0.3.2 into separate entities for the
    individual browsers and reserved an online location for future uploads.



· (( 2o14-o3-27 ))

Update:
    Started creating a vastly improved user customization of the quicklinks.



· (( 2o14-o3-26 ))

Code optimization (attempt):
    Attempted (but failed) to optimize the module-loading in Chrome. Cannot iterate in
    a for-loop and avoid redundancy. 'twas worth a try.


Graphic design:
    Minorly updated the FLEX banner.


Bugfix:
    At times, Chrome failed to inject my script soon enough to catch the on-load-train.
    That's because I used false jQuery implementation. Now it should be fixed for good.


Update:
    Implemented a newer version of jQuery, 1.11.0, and also figured out better jQuery
    implementation.



· (( 2o14-o3-18 ))

Bugfix:
    My aspect-ratio fix erroneously affected honorable mentions, too.



· (( 2o14-o2-25 ))

New feature:
    Fix broken thumbnail aspect ratio. GODDAMNIT, FINALLY! That has been annoying me since
    my first month on unikGamer. ("View someone's list" only).


New feature:
    Fix the long-ass Eligibility box whose faulty design has become super obvious with
    the newest list "Inspirational People".


Cross-browser support:
    Working on the Firefox developer environment.



· (( 2o14-o2-13 ))

Bugfix:
    The background script of my preferences page was actually called on *any* web page.
    Instead of just the preferences page itself. This only happened in Opera.



· (( 2o14-o2-12 ))

New feature:
    Enable navigating through the Recent Pages via the left|right arrow keys.


Bugfix:
    Fixed my feature "lose focus on submit" which wasn't working for input and textarea
    elements.


Bugfix:
    Fixed browser detection in my preferences page (Opera and Chrome).


New feature:
    Submit forms with enter key (in Chrome, too, like you can in Opera *by default*).


Bugfind:
    Ugh! I was wrong. It's still unfixed, that Chrome-script-loading issue. Trying
    (and failing) to reproduce it.



· (( 2o14-o2-11 ))

Bugfix (attempt):
    Sometimes my script was called too late – when the document was already loaded – and
    thus, failing to inject my modules, making it seem like the modules themselves were
    buggy. (affected Chrome only)


Bugfix:
    Always focusing the first text field (when editing a Page) deemed to be an unwise
    choice (on the category "fictional character" it would always focus the YouTube field
    at the bottom, resulting in an unwanted scroll-jump). I've enhanced the functionality
    to also consider comboboxes of interest.
