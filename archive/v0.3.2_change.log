[[ v0.3.2 ]]
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

· (( 2o14-o2-o8 ))

Graphic design:
    Overhauled the logo.


Description:
    Added more textual explanations for my features.


Cross-browser support:
    Quick-n-dirtily synched Chrome's script structure with Opera's. Rudimentary feature
    tests.



· (( 2o14-o2-o6 ))

Graphic design:
    Created a better textual and visual explanation for some more of my features.


Cross-browser support:
    Add-on Builder for Firefox will soon be retired. Started setting up a new and
    different type of developer environment.



· (( 2o14-o2-o5 ))

Code cleanup:
    Implemented a favicon command for my preferences page. Further synched Opera's and
    Chrome's preferences code, manifest file and general file structure.


New feature:
    Quick-n-dirtily implemented a fix for the YouTube overlay issue (in Opera).



· (( 2o14-o2-o2 ))

Graphic design:
    Created a better textual and visual explanation for half of my features.


Bugfix:
    Showing the visual explanation in my preferences window flickers due to suboptimal
    onmouseout-event-handling.


Styling:
    Re-designed the preferences page.



· (( 2o14-o2-o1 ))

Graphic design:
    Created a new extension logo.


Code cleanup:
    Smartfully slimmened (›‹ ) … the background code for the preferences logic. And now
    I can use the exact same code for both, Opera and Chrome, for faster and more elegant
    cross-browser-coding.


Bugfix:
    On-mouse-over search results of mega-meta-master search caused an error if a ‹li›
    other than li.result was being hovered (i.e. category header such as "People").


New Feature:
    Fixed broken submit of mega-meta-master search = block improper redirect to front page.
    And at the same time, rather auto-redirect to the corresponding Page if the current
    search yields exactly one search result.


Code cleanup:
     Created module.js, proper ordered segmentation of funcs, nice separator comments.
     Further synched Opera and Chrome versions. Added a change.log file.
