FLEX â€“ Favslist Expansion
====

by WoodrowShigeru


Customize and expand your Favslist experience.


FLEX is a browser add-on that I started developing around September 2o13.

It is intended to enhance the browsing experience of the website  http://www.favslist.com/

Adding three modules with which the users could, for example, implement their own customized 
so-called "Quicklinks", it started out as a userScript for Opera 12.16 and has been 
re-imagined again and again ever since.
